# ü•è UltimateApp - Disc In

Developing an app to enhance Ultimate coaching abilities

## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

You need a recent version of nodejs.

Clone the project and install all its dependancies:

```
git clone git@github.com:disc-in/UltimateApp.git
cd UltimateApp
yarn install
```

Copy the environment file and fill the blanks:

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

(Firebase env variables are only used if you share custom plays or drills)

And finally, start the project:

```
yarn start
```

## üëè Contributing

If you want to contribute to the projet, just pick up an issue from the [list](https://github.com/disc-in/UltimateApp/issues) and start fixing it. You can then open a pull-request so that your contribution can be merged into the main branch.

Found a bug? Take 5 minutes to [report it](https://github.com/disc-in/UltimateApp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)

Not a developer? We always need people to help us with:

- improving the **wording** of the application, drills, training programs, to make it easier to understand;
- drawing the **animations** of the drills in the app;
- **testing** the app;
- **gathering feedback** from our users;
- **processing the feedbacks** we get to decide which features should be implemented;

Feel free to contact us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DiscInApp) or by email (ultimate.discin_at_gmail.com) to discuss it.

### Tests

We expect every code introduced via a pull-request to be tested.
We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react-native) and [React Native Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) as testing frameworks. Please refer to the documentation, look at [existing tests](https://github.com/disc-in/UltimateApp/blob/main/src/Components/DrillListPage.test.js) or ask questions if needed.

### Mock http records

We use [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) to mock HTTP calls. Have look at an example [here](https://github.com/disc-in/UltimateApp/blob/main/src/Components/shared/VimeoVideo.test.js).

To get the expected return from Nock, you can run your tests without mocking and record the http calls. The documentation is [there](https://github.com/nock/nock#recording).

## Release

Note: You need to understand how environment variables are managed in an expo app. It is completely different from a web application because the app bundle is sent to every user. There is no such place as a safe server environment config.

- Environment variables in Expo https://docs.expo.dev/guides/environment-variables/
- Environment variables and secrets in the build process (EAS Build): https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/variables/

Most of our environment variables are set directly in app.config.js. Our secrets (eg. API tokens) are set in the environment and on our Expo Account (so that EAS Build can access them).

To release a new version of the app :

1. Send a pull request updating the version in `app.config.js`. If new binaries must be built, this is a major version update and you must also update the buildNumber (ios) and versionCode (android)
2. When it is merged, create a release on Github
3. Make sure your `.env` file contains the production environment variables up-to-date (especially APP_ENV)
4. Make sure the secrets on our expo account are set
5. Use `expo start --clear` to make sure the new env vars have been taken into account
6. Then

- If publishing an update, run `expo publish --release-channel production`
- If building a new major version, rebuild for the stores using `eas build --platform <ios|android|all> --profile <profile-name>` and and `eas submit`

7. Set back your development env vars in `.env` and run `expo start --clear`
